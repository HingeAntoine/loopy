# loopy

An implementation of the Loopy game, also known as Slitherlink, Takegaki, Fences, and Loop the Loop

This is my rendition of Loopy for the web. I first became aware of it through a Stack Overflow question that no longer exists. The question asked for a method of verifying solutions, which is an easy graph-theoretical task. I was more interested in the graphical implementation. Unfortunately, the question disappeared while I was working on my program.

The rules of Loopy are described by Simon Tatham:

There is an extensive analysis on Wikipedia:

If the game seems hard, you're right. It has been shown to be NP-complete.
